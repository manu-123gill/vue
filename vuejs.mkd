# vuejs

## When working with Vue.js, we can conveniently destructure object elements, just as we would in JavaScript. 
```sh
<script setup>
const users = [
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    id: "12345",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    age: 30
  },
  {
    name: "Jane Smith",
    id: "67890",
    email: "jane.smith@example.com",
    age: 25
  }
];
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>User Details</h2>
    <div v-for="{ name, id, email, age } in users" :key="id">
      <h3>{{ name }}</h3>
      <p>ID: {{ id }}</p>
      <p>Email: {{ email }}</p>
      <p>Age: {{ age }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

## By leveraging object destructuring in Vue.js, we can directly access the properties of an object, simplifying our code and making it more readable.

This approach also helps reduce redundancy and enhances the overall maintainability of the codebasewith objects containing numerous properties, eliminating 

the need to use dot notation repeatedly, such as user.name, user.email, user.age.
